@para A few months back while scrolling on YouTube Shorts, I came across a video that played a lofi, fast forwarded cover of some song that I had never heard. The words and the melody were too good to forget, so I ended up shazaming it and thanks to Spotify and it's suggestions found a playlist worth of (mainly old) rock songs.
