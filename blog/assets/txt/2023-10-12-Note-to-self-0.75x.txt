@para Consider slowing down a little bit. Not everything has to happen as quickly as possible. You can put that sock on a bit slowly you know? You can take 5 more minutes to eat that breakfast. You don't have to reach the office within 5 minutes, you can take 15.

@para I know often time there's this lingering unease within yourself, this restless feeling as if everything you do is dictated by a deadline. But it's not. You don't need to gulp down a glass of water as if it's going to evaporate if you don't, you can take your time.

@para Try this, every time you become aware that you are rushing through something, stop, take a deep breath, close your eyes  (not while driving) and imagine yourself to be a video that's going too fast. You need to push that 0.75x button.

@para And once that button is pushed, try enjoying whatever it is that you are doing, notice your breathing, is it too shallow? Try breathing a bit deeper.

@para Almost everything will be exactly the same even if you took a little bit more time, but you will be different. You will be calmer and less anxious.
