1 - The  TRUNCATE TABLE statement deletes all data from a table without scanning it. This is the reason why it is faster than the DELETE statement.
2 - In addition, the TRUNCATE TABLE statement reclaims the storage right away so you do not have to perform a subsequent VACUMM operation, which is useful in the case of large tables.

Summary
1 - Use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement to delete all data from a large table.
2 - Use the CASCADE option to truncate a table and other tables that reference the table via foreign key constraint.
3 - The TRUNCATE TABLE does not fire ON DELETE trigger. Instead, it fires the BEFORE TRUNCATE and AFTER TRUNCATE triggers.
4 - The TRUNCATE TABLE statement is transaction-safe. It means that if you place it within a transaction, you can roll it back safely.
