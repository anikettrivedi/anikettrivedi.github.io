Subqueries are of 2 types
1 - Non-correlated or simple subqueries
2 - Correlated subqueries
    1 - These subqueries use output from outer query as contraint in the inner query
    2 - Generally these types of subqueries are more expensive to execute, as inner query needs to run once for each row from outer query result
